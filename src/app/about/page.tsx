        <p>
          Crypt@trix is the annual Cryptic Hunt event hosted at Ordin@trix.
          Cryptic hunts are online scavenger hunt competitions where
          participants are given a series of challenging clues, requiring sharp
          investigative skills, clever thinking, and foresight to solve
          difficult puzzles. You will need to pair up with the Internet to
          advance in the event.

        <h2>Capture the Flag</h2>
        <p>
          Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges are amusing cybersecurity
          challenges. Participants find text strings called "flags" that are
          secretly hidden in deliberate vulnerable programs or websites, or use
          a clever encryption or steganographic algorithm to conceal data. CTF
          helps beginners explore the realm of cybersecurity. The objective of
          CTF is not just raising cybersecurity awareness, but also
          understanding how vulnerabilities in your applications may be
          exploited.

        <h2>Preparing for Cryptic Hunts</h2>
        <p>
          Practice makes perfect; participating in this year's Cryptic Hunts
          will help you master cryptography. Remember, each level consists a set
          of clues, all of which lead to a single answer. The difficulty
          increases with each level. You can find clues in various locations…
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This website</li>
          <li>The title of a page</li>
          <li>The URL of a page</li>
          <li>Somewhere on the screen</li>
          <li>Somewhere in the source code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a media file such as an image, a video, or a document is given,
          think creatively! Encrypting or decrypting text, reversing audio,
          checking file properties, and so on can help you find the answer.

        <h2>Cryptography and Steganography</h2>
        <p>
          Decryption is the heart of a cryptic hunt like Crypt@trix. You might
          find text decoded using a cipher. Images may also be used to decode
          strings. The most common way of solving this is through steganography,
          which might help you bring concealed text to light.
